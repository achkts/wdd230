      <h3>The Process page</h3>
      <p>
        The Process of making of donuts
        There are 3 main components to making donuts. 
        Making Dough
        Cooking/Frying
        Decorating

        Dough 
        Starting with a good base is key. At commercial companies they have their base made and you just follow their recipes and mix. Then you roll the dough out and cut to the shapes you desire. Remember to let your dough rest through the process, from letting the dough rest after mixing, before you cut your shapes,  to letting it proof properly. This is part of what creates the fluffiness and melt-in-your-mouth taste. Totally worth the wait!
        There are several recipes for doughnuts that anyone can find online. Try them out and find your favorite one! 

        Frying
          Another important factor to making donuts is the kind of oil you fry in and the temperature that you use. Most commercial companies have a donut frying oil that can be a mix of oils that look similar to Crisco that are formulated for high temperatures and have a neutral flavor. For frying at home, canola oil is a great neutral oil that can handle high temperatures. Most frying temperatures for donuts range from 340 to 370 degrees fahrenheit. 

          Commercial fryers are large and can handle a large capacity of frying donuts at one time. At home, use a deep pan, like a dutch oven, that you can fry in with high sides that will less likely to splash on you and cause burns. Make sure to fry each side until a nice golden brown color.  A fun way at work and at home are flipping donuts with wooden sticks. Just remember to be careful with the hot oil, especially at home if there are little ones around, because you can get severe burns from the oil.

        Decorating
            The last part to delicious donuts is the decorating! Head to the next page for delicious decorating and fun!

      <h3>Decorating page</h3>
      <p>
        There are many different ways to frost a donut that help create an endless canvas of deliciousness. Here are some following picture ideas of how to frost donuts. All of these methods can be done in a commercial kitchen or at home.

        Frost
        Drizzle
        Dip
        Pipe
        Glaze
        Flavors
        Get creative! Find flavors that work well together and experiment. Regular flavors include maple, chocolate and vanilla. Try combinations like chocolate and peppermint, or adding apples and caramel. Do you have a favorite ice cream, pie or other dessert? Try to create that same flavor in your donut. Fillings are a great way to add a delicious custard or try another filling you enjoy. Have fun and get messy!
        Inspiration
        The internet is full of so many ideas. Some really fantastic inspiration for decorating donuts comes from decorated sugar cookies! Other inspirations can come from cultural celebrations, holidays and other national days. Don’t forget you can use sprinkles for a special touch, plastic rings or other kinds of decorations to spice up your decorating. Have fun and enjoy the process.
